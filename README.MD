# Little Rocket Lab Mods

This repository contains releases for mods developed for the game *Little Rocket Lab*. These mods are built from separate repositories and will be added here as they are completed.

## Available Mods

- [Toasty Break Rock](link-to-release) - Allows Toasty to break rocks (Be aware if you get to close to a large resource, it will break it and either crash or freeze your game for a while).
- [Infinite Resources](link-to-release) - Pretty simple, makes resources infinite.
- [Time Bender](link-to-release) - Allows you to control time! Currently only able to pause time, but new config coming out soon to just slow down time.

## Installation
