## Available Mods

- [Toasty Break Rock](https://github.com/histerical/little-rocket-lab-mods/releases/latest) - Allows Toasty to break rocks. (Now only breaks small rocks!)

- [Infinite Resources](https://github.com/histerical/little-rocket-lab-mods/releases/latest) - Pretty simple, makes resources infinite.

- [Time Bender](https://github.com/histerical/little-rocket-lab-mods/releases/latest) - Allows you to control time! Currently only able to pause time (hotkey: F8), but new config coming out soon to just slow down time.
